# Toolformer Training Pipeline for Web Search

This repository contains a training pipeline for fine-tuning Llama 2 3B model with Toolformer approach, specifically for web search capabilities.

## Overview

The Toolformer approach enhances language models by teaching them to use external tools through in-context function calling. This implementation focuses on web search functionality, allowing the model to learn when and how to perform web searches during text generation.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- CUDA-compatible GPU (recommended)
- Access to Llama 2 3B model
- Hugging Face account with access to Llama 2 models

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone [repository-url]
cd toolformer-websearch
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Set up environment variables:
Create a `.env` file with:
```
HUGGING_FACE_TOKEN=your_token_here
WANDB_API_KEY=your_wandb_key_here
```

## Project Structure

- `config.py`: Configuration settings for training
- `data_preparation.py`: Scripts for generating training data
- `train.py`: Main training script
- `requirements.txt`: Project dependencies

## Usage

1. Generate training data:
```bash
python data_preparation.py
```

2. Start training:
```bash
python train.py
```

## Training Process

The training pipeline consists of several steps:

1. **Data Preparation**:
   - Generates examples from Wikipedia text
   - Augments text with web search tool usage
   - Creates training and evaluation datasets

2. **Model Training**:
   - Fine-tunes Llama 2 3B model
   - Adds special tokens for tool usage
   - Uses causal language modeling with tool calling objectives

3. **Evaluation**:
   - Tracks tool usage accuracy
   - Monitors training progress with W&B

## Configuration

Key configuration parameters in `config.py`:

- Model settings (model name, sequence length)
- Training parameters (batch size, learning rate, etc.)
- Tool-specific settings (web search configuration)
- Logging and evaluation settings

## Results

The trained model will be saved in the `final_model` directory. Training progress and metrics can be monitored through Weights & Biases dashboard.
